Approach - 1:
1. Divide dataset into training and validation dataset
2. Feed it to Resnet50, VGG16 and check performance.
3. Dynamic Data Augmnetation performed.
4. Training accuracy : 63% 
   Validation accuracy : 65%
Remarks: Small dataset, data was not preprocessed properly. Could be the reason behind low accuracy

Approach - 2:
1. Change preprocessing strategy
2. Build a custom CNN architechture and check performance.
3. Training accuracy :  
   Validation accuracy :
Remarks:

Approach - 3:
1. Add more data from different data source
2. Datasets used:
