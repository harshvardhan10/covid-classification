Approach - 1:

1. Divide dataset into training and validation dataset
2. Feed it to Resnet50, VGG16 and check performance.
3. Dynamic Data Augmnetation performed.
4. Training accuracy : 63% 
   Validation accuracy : 65%

Approach - 2:
1. Change data preprocessing strategy
2. Add more data from different data source
3. Datasets used: 
    3.1 https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database - Can be directly used
    3.2 https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset - Needs to be preprocessed
4. Build a custom CNN architechture and check performance.
5. Training accuracy :  
   Validation accuracy :
